Recent changelog of the newest features:

next update will likely be Sunday, unless i fix something Saturday.

V0.4.3 Released 10/5/18 at 11 pm, PST. Ah yes, a new update. I've had a hard week with school and stuff, haven't been able to update. Did have to make a "outdated code" update 10/2 as the bot wouldn't start.. gonna be seeing lots of those. However, a nice new update is out now. Support Server is live, use |support for some more information. Big, big update Sunday with some bot-info commands (hopefully.)
V0.4.3: This update brings 4 new commands and some new improvements.

"4" new commands. Mainly, hurricanenames, retirednames, support and changelog FIANLLY work. Support is really the new one.

Data for Active Tropical Storms, hurricanes, and AOD (Areas Of Development) now pulls data every 3-7 hours. I know, the update didn't really change. The Alantic and Pacific Centers only update their stuff at different times, unless something suddenly happens, they update every 2-5. The data being pulled WILL be in that 2-5 hour range soon.

Legit have patched the |hurricane command.. if anymore issues acome, the command will be disabled, this is the 3rd time.

Removed Media command. All Media can be found when using the normal help commnad.

Updated the help command with a little bit more information.

Changelog command should now work. However, in the embed, at the end it comes up with undefined. I've been trying for a few hours now to fix it, but it isn't working. So for now, pretend it isn't there.

Fix for when using |ats, it would slow the bot down to almost 24% of normal speed.
